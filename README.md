# Teach me how to produce music ploxxx!!
This is NOT meant to be a daw with easy sample imports or high quality audio.
This project is meant to be a playground for new producers to learn the basics of synthesis or to mess around with ideas quickly before moving to their favorite daw !
There should be import and export tools, interactive tutorials based on relevant information online and a way to make your own (once development finishes).
The fx should also be able to pack together following the magical concept of *encapsulation* and every effect possible should be able to get reproduced with no paywall.
This also makes it possible to expect more technical knowledge out of the learner and for instance not provide a phaser but instead teach how to construct one from all-pass filters.
As this is a web application there is no real way to chase performance or professionnal quality audio.
The web audio api seems really well designed but I see no way it can equal in any way the steinberg or AU plugin formats.
Could I make this mobile-friendly???\

## Things that YOU could help with
- Making the UI less ugly (am a programmer not a visual artist or a web designer...)
- Giving ideas/resources on how to synthesize both the most beautiful leads and pads and the most intense kicks and wubs ever
- Writing informative tutorials that do not revolve around bullshit audio engineer vocabulary (if I hear one more time someone say a mix is muddy without elaborating I'll snap)
- Proposing a good refactor of the js code (I will not submit to your favorite framework that's going to waste 60Gb of ram though sorry)
- Talking with me about music production in general (I wish to learn more)
